M102 - General notes
====================
About a year and a half ago, [I attended the M101JS](http://dev.topheman.com/mongodb-for-node-js-developers-certificate/) : MongoDB for NodeJS Developers ([link to current session](https://university.mongodb.com/courses/M101JS/about)).

Since then, MongoDB university launches courses about every four months (correct me if I'm wrong).

[I decided to attend to the M102: MongoDB for DBAs](https://university.mongodb.com/courses/M102/about).

**I'm not a DBA**. I don't pretend to be or become one, but since I was in web development, I've been working with databases. Here are the reasons why I'm attending this course :

* I've already passed the M101 for developers. Whatever, it would be a good way to refresh my mind about all those concepts
* It will be more focused on scalability, performance, from an administrator's point of view : always good to know (even in pure development, can be reusable)
* As I said, I'm not a DBA, so I'll try my best, even if I don't succeed, I'll have learned lots of interesting things

This repo contains my general notes, taken on the fly while watching the video courses. I may need them as a reminder for later and it *might* help someone else ...
