M102 - General notes
====================
About a year and a half ago, [I attended the M101JS : MongoDB for NodeJS Developers](http://dev.topheman.com/mongodb-for-node-js-developers-certificate/). Since then, MongoDB university launches courses about every four three months.

I decided to attend to the [M102: MongoDB for DBAs](https://university.mongodb.com/courses/M102/about) and successfully completed.

**I'm not a DBA**. I don't pretend to be or become one, but since I was in web development, I've been working with databases. Here are the reasons why I attended this course :

* I've already passed the M101 for developers. Whatever, it's a good way to refresh my mind about all those concepts
* It's more focused on scalability, performance, from an administrator's point of view : always good to know (even in pure development, can be reusable)

This repo contains my general notes, taken on the fly while watching the video courses. I may need them as a reminder for later and it *might* help someone else ...
